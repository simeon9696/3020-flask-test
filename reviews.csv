Awesome place.",I tried to order steak kebob but they made beef kebob. I asked for tzaziki on the side but they covered all the meat with tzaziki. Taste is more like middle eastern. Not Mediterranean. Price is good. Taste is okay.,"Very delicious food in love with cucumber drink, couldn't decide what I wanted and one specific Gentelman whipped up something very amazing for me! By the name of Jamil great service! Thanks you and will definitely be back!",Woww! My order:   Chicken Schwarma with a side of hummus and pita. Order of falafel. Cucumber drink. Side of garlic sauce. Side of cucumber sauce. Absolutely clean filling. Taste delicious! Will have you craving for more. I can't believe I hadn't heard of this restaurant sooner. After the fact I realize this place is all the rave!,I was thinking this would be more of a sit down restaurant where you order from the table instead of a chipotleish style of Mediterranean food. Thought there would be more room inside for eating. The only thing good I had was the cucumber chiller which I would go back for. Not so much the food / service.,Parsley Modern Mediterranean is wonderful. Very responsive staff. Food is wonderful. I usually get the wraps (chicken or beef are my go - tos). Babaganoush and the warm pita bread is pretty amazing.,The food always taste fresh and leaves me very full without feeling tired. They have had a groupon for a very long time making this place an incredible value. This is my favorite Mediterranean place.,Now this place is really good i always drive past it but today i decided to stop an check it out it is really good healthy an fresh,"This is Chipotle for Mediterranean food. And it. delicious. I've only been here once because the location is very inconvenient for me and I'm extremely lazy about driving more than 5 minutes to go anywhere, but if it were closer, I'd be here all the time. ( It's probably better this way, I have very little self - control . ) If you like spicy - get the hot sauce. Mix it with the white sauce, you won't be disappointed.","good,Price,value-for-money,positive;okay,Taste,food -> quality,neutral;Very,delicious,food -> quality,positive;great,service,staff,positive;wonderful,Parsley Modern Mediterranean,food -> quality,positive;Very responsive,staff,staff,positive;wonderful,Food,food -> quality,positive;pretty amazing,pita bread,food -> quality,positive;incredible,value,value-for-money,positive;favorite,Mediterranean place,recommendation,positive;really good,place,recommendation,positive;very,location,location,negative",good Price [SEP] okay Taste [SEP] Very delicious [SEP] great service [SEP] wonderful Parsley Modern Mediterranean [SEP] Very responsive staff [SEP] wonderful Food [SEP] pretty amazing pita bread [SEP] incredible value [SEP] favorite Mediterranean place [SEP] really good place [SEP] very location

They don't skip on the seafood. We didn't come with a reservation, which kind of threw them off their game. Food didn't come out very quickly this time, however, there was a large party so for the small kitchen it was understandable. My fav item tonight was the salted carmel cheesecake. The reason for the three star review is because they do not accept credit / debit cards...cash or check only.","Very cool decor and atmosphere, but extremely limited menu and both times we were there, they were out of something we ordered. Also, a little pricey for what you get.",Over priced specials. Not good. The clam chowder was good. Everything else mediocre at best. Place smells too,Very good!

The chicken is by far their specialty here and if you stop by I recommend trying it. The price is very cheap here but one down side is they only accept cash.,"We call this "" Red Chicken. It's consistently good, always fresh and tasty and you can't beat the prices. I love both the chicken and the beef. The beans are rather bland, but the salsa, rice,   and pickled onions all go together for an explosion of flavor.","I like this place. The food here is like what you'd get at a typical taco stand in Nogales, but without the dysentery. The chicken and beef are equally tasty, but I tend to favor the beef because it's boneless and less work trying to get it all into the tortillas.","It could be a lot better, but with no competition around, they do nt have to be. The chicken is basic charbroiled, some times overcooked & dry, averagely seasoned, and portions are ok Sirloin is adequate, plays it safe with the amount of marinade & spice. But at least its decently quality & tender meat. Beans are average beans & they fill their role as a side item just fine. The salsa is terrible mashed tomatoes. Service is lacking, slow, and cash only is annoying.","One of the best deals and delicious beef and chicken combinations out there. It is a whole in the wall and just a gem. I will totally cater with a tray of this stuff, but may end up hoarding it to myself.",This is as close as the chicken that you will get in Mexico this stuff is to die for you can't even simulated   at home with the El Pollo Loco seasoning salt. we go to Rocky Point Mexico and gotta stop and get the chicken in town right on the Main Street it's killer.,"My bro and I have found this place by chance. The smell from the restaurant street were delicious and we couldn't wait to taste it! The best beef and chicken you'll find in Phoenix! And it's only 15 minutes away from the airport! For sure, I will recommend it!","Nice simple Mexican food at a great price, love the charbroiled steak and the beans so flavorful with out a lot of stuff added. Called my order in but when I walked inside the smell was so good I had to tell them to make mine to eat in. Next time I will try the combo cause the beef was so tasty I know that charbroiled chicken will be just a good if not better. Just remember CASH ONLY you can eat for as little as $5 but bring $10 and you can get anything you want.","To my homesick Indianz from Arizona, if you want home cooked food (beef, beans, tortillas) this is THE PLACE. Tri - tip grilled on actual mesquite, tortillas that taste as close to homemade as possible, and they will actually grill jalapenos for you. And the beans, oh the beans, just like Moms.

I had the Dolly breakfast sandwich and I feel like it lacked flavor.  The staff could be more attentive.  We waited several minutes before we were even addressed.  Its a decent place, but overall, I'm not a fan.",Great hip breakfast in Gilbert. Food and waitress Kayla were excellent. Reviews didn't do it justice. We will be back.,"I think Over Easy is a very nice breakfast place. Yes, it is more expensive then Ihop and Denny's but the food is really good and has some unique options. I have had in my visits the Dolly breakfast sandwich (egg, tomato, bacon on a English muffin), brioche French toast (plain and Banana's Foster) and the chocolate chip pancakes. Service is also good and overall, it's a nice breakfast place.","Not good at all. The young staff basically ignores you if you have any grey hair. The food was just OK, but I won't be back. The Good Egg is much better.",We love the service and food. The staff is always friendly. Daniela always takes care of us and remembers us by name!!! It's our favorite breakfast place.,"Visited for the first time this morning and even though it was recommended by a friend who'd dined 2 - 3 times before I was hesitant seeing all the negative reviews. We thought it was great! Arrived at 8 : 15, sat on the patio and had great food & service. We had the brioche french toast, waffle dogs & scrambled eggs - all were great! We will definitely be back.","Had the biscuits and gravy...they were OK. ( Bland, not as warm as they could have been). Also couldn't help but notice the couple sitting next to us, sending both of their meals back for being cold. I realize this location has just opened - so I may wait a while before giving Over Easy another go. 3 stars are for our friendly waitress and the yummy Bloody Mary mix.","I want to give a 2 stars because the service staff was friendly and good as well as ambience was decent. But we came here for food not to meet the staff. Food was just really mediocre, not even hot. The hashbrowns taste pre - cut and frozen. The "" real maple syrup "" is just a maple syrup blend. I could make a lot better food myself. We had pancakes, bacon, and the wolf pack. All the prices were way too high with food that's more on par with denny's. Would rather IHOP across the street. Unfortunately it looks like another lackluster joint resides here (before nypd pizza).","I really never post any reviews but this place deserves it. I come here often and the food tastes great like always. The brioche banana toast are to die for as well as the pancakes, I've really never tasted anything like it before. The place is cozy and clean and the staff is amazing, not really much more to ask for except I wish they add crepes that would the cherry on top.","very nice,breakfast place,food -> quality,positive;great,food,food -> quality,positive;love,service,staff,positive;just OK,food,food -> quality,neutral;always friendly,staff,staff,positive;Great hip,breakfast,food -> quality,positive;excellent,waitress Kayla,staff,positive;unique,options,food -> variety,positive;young,staff,staff,negative;better,Egg,food -> quality,positive;negative,reviews,recommendation,negative;OK,biscuits and gravy,food -> quality,neutral;friendly,waitress,staff,positive;yummy,Bloody Mary mix,food -> quality,positive;decent,ambience,restaurant -> atmosphere,positive",very nice breakfast place [SEP] great food [SEP] love service [SEP] just OK food [SEP] always friendly staff [SEP] Great hip breakfast [SEP] excellent waitress Kayla [SEP] unique options [SEP] young staff [SEP] better Egg [SEP] negative reviews [SEP] OK biscuits and gravy [SEP] friendly waitress [SEP] yummy Bloody Mary mix [SEP] decent ambience

Their actual food they bring you isn't as good as the buffet in general, and they charge you by weight at the salad bar which is something you wouldn't really expect. It can come out expensive. Their coffee is decent though and the workers are friendly, and it's also pretty clean.","Awesome place for nice coffee and great delicious food!!! I would definitely recommend it! Our new favorite restaurant for lunch in Downtown Las Vegas    Thanks to the beautiful owner, Silvia!","This place is my new favorite! Their coffee is soo good, you can make a ton of different combinations or just stick to the basics. Their selection of teas are great too and they are amazing quality! Super yummy. I had a pesto chicken pannini that was effing delicious. The staff is super nice, the girls are really sweet. Everything about this place it's awesome. Totally go there!","I was looking for just a place to get breakfast and coffee that didn't involve flashing lights or clouds of smoke. I was relived to find this cafe within walking distance of my downtown hotel! I had a toasted marshmallow iced latte and a breakfast burrito. I don't remember which one I ordered but it was a vegetarian burrito with avocado and egg as two main ingredients. And isn't that what is really most important? it was also fun to people watch all the law enforcement officers and legal professionals as they came in. Plus, free wi - fi! Will definitely come again.","Great lunch spot downtown. Food tastes good. They also have one of the best - tasting coffees around - they use Illy, of course. Prices reasonable.","I ate here this week and it was good place for a quick uncomplicated breakfast. I had bacon, eggs, toast and a hash brown. Good coffee by the way. Wonderful staff. Typical business district downtown type eatery. This is nothing fancy but it does hit the spot and is very well maintained.

Their food is really great and at a fair price too ... We've since been back a couple times and have continued to enjoy this great spot! Antrese has been our server every time so far and we've been impressed by how nice and helpful she has been! Definitely recommend.,"This review is for the salad bar, I feel like I need to warn you. It's a total rip - off because they weigh your food. $ 13 and some change for a salad! I say more. I definitely would've left out the rubber tasting chicken and nasty croutons. I will stick with Jason's Deli, better selection and you can have all the salad you want for one price.","Let`s start with the good stuff first. Clean place and friendly workers. The paninis are great (a bit overpriced) but you definitely get what you pay for as it is a big portion. The buffet is great especially if you`re down on cash and want a variety of food on your plate. Breakfast is not great at all! I would definitely not recommend it at all.

I was looking for a sandwich and found this place as rated very high by fellow yelpers. I ordered their veggie pizza sub. It was huge, I ate it for lunch and dinner. It was very nice and juicy.

The sandwiches are wonderful, and I'm glad that they survived the gas explosion, and came back strong!

Caters to breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The food is still great!","So I had the pleasure of eating at both locations while in PHX and this one out did the original! I had this gin, lemon and soda water drink which solved my pissy attitude towards the airport :). For food I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup and added bacon to the grilled cheese. They had awesome buttery bread and the soup was nice and thick. Every employee seemed like they were having a great day which helped as many of us were grumpy from canceled and delayed flight. Prices were good so I strongly recommend!",What a fantastic spot to grab a meal. I got the Bloody Mary and meatloaf. Every ingredient in the Bloody Mary was perfect. Extra crispy celery. Briny olives. Crispy thick bacon. Meatloaf was excellent.,"Great food!! Everything tastes great and was truly fresh as advertised. I got here early enough to not have to brave the long line out front (although knowing what I know now I would have happily done it). The eggs were fresh, the bacon looked and tasted like real bacon, the waffle was fluffy and delicious and the orange juice which came out of a gigantic plastic jar I'm sure was squeezed that morning.",Very good breakfast that was well prepared. The Bloody Mary is an excellent choice. It comes with a salad bar in it! I highly recommend it.,"Quick service all around. Amazing food ... Sky Harbor has revamped their food choices and I can honestly say this place is up there with Arizona top breakfast places (heard good things about their other locations as well . ) Great ok every way. Oh, and the bacon. The bacon was unbelievable.","First time at the airport in Phoenix, and Matt's is a pleasant surprise and great breakfast for airport restaurants.

This place seems like the spot that would be packed all of the time, so expect to be rubbing elbows with a stranger while you eat. Aside from this, the food was great!

Great place!,Went with my wife to go and check out the gun counter for their up and coming Black Friday sale and seen some firearms we wanted to buy that day that wasn't listed for the sale. The Employees all had rude trash attitudes especially one named Erwin. I spoke with the manager Brad and suggested that the employees in that department take a diversity education training. Due to their ignorance I won't be shopping there again.,This was a fun place to visit even if you did not buy anything. There were so many outdoor and sport gear. An large aquarium and a large selection of hunted animal. My friend from another country also felt fancinate to see a large selection of guns and ammo. Guns were outlawed in some other country.,"Disappointed in the service we received today. The place was extremely packed with Holiday shoppers and only 4 checkout lanes were open. Stood in long lines to purchase our items and the cashier did not apologize for the wait, instead made the comment that she wasn't sorry because she has a job. Bass Pro should consider having a bigger staff this close to Christmas and have every checkout lane open.","I don't really actually shop at Bass Pro. But I love walking around, looking at everything, and playing the games at Bass Pro. It's a fun store to just meander about. And they have different shooting games, checkers, etc . that you can play. Plus there's the stream and waterfall with fish, turtles, and ducks, as well as all the stuffed critters all over the store. It's a free / cheap way to spend a couple of hours. And if you do happen to be into fishing and/or hunting, you'll find what you need here. All in all, I'm a fan simply because I always have fun walking around and looking at everything here.","Purchased a pair of upland pants for hunting season on sale. Only paid $29. First time I wore them, I got them very dirty and the reinforced fronts ripped out. Returned for a full in store refund. Was only $29, but still, great service even though the product (Browning) was mediocre.","This store is HUGE and is a great place to buy thinks for use in the outdoors. I love the entry with the life - size animals, the aquarium, and the water feature. Love this place. Come here if you need anything for the outdoors!!","This place is a riot. From a "" tourist "" stand point there is suprisingly alot of fun to be had. Especially if you don't take yourself seriously. My Dad, friend and I had an under cover security guard watching us closely by the time we left (not very sneaky sir). Be sure to watch the fishing demonstration, watching live fish strike bait live is pretty dang cool. If you're in Vegas, like the outdoors, and feel like releasing some of your redneck side, this place is great.","This place is full of knowledgeable and friendly staff if you need help with their crossbow range or with firearms. A few years ago I also had the store gun smith change the sights on a few pistols and they did an excellent job.

They're clean (this one is), affordable, good quality, no long lines, easy return / exchange, convenient parking and location, and great customer service! I've also been going to the pharmacy and I love their $ 4 . 00 prescription program. Whether or not you have insurance they will still give it you for $4 . 00 as long as its in that list. Their pharmacist and pharmacy tech are really nice, not like other pharmacies.","Oh hey, it's a Target. I was in this neighborhood and somehow thought this Target location might be nicer than others. Meh, it was and it wasn't. It was basically the same as every other Target. Nothing remarkable to report. It's a Target. It's got everything any Target would have. It's perfectly fine. It's clean enough.","This has to be one of my favorite Targets by far! Very clean and organized. I love shopping here because I don't feel rushed to grab and go like I do in Walmart, just to get away from the riff raff. I can never go in and just buy what I came in for! lol!

For some reason my online orders couldn't be processed so she call target. com for me and handle everything with them for me! Spoke to Terrence about it and he was great too!,I had the best experience with Jane! I came in today for a few things and am always in a rush. They pharmacy paged her and she opened up the locked toothbrushes in record time. Additionally she recommended some facial masks. She then checked me out and I was swiftly on my way.

Their price match policy is an absolute joke. Target will only honor the price match policy on THEIR OWN website if it lists a dollar amount not if lists buy one get one half off.

I wish the place was bigger.  The staff was very attentive.  Good place to eat, but nothing outstanding.","By the end of the week here, I resorted to mostly soup and salad. Here I tried the french onion soup which was salty, but a bit too cheesy as well. To top it off, I had the Nicoise salad , tuna was okay, bit too peppery. I was full after lunch, but it could have been the soup that really filled me up. Our afternoon server was definitely very much in the joking mood and provided great entertainment for the table.","Before this dinner we popped into La Cave and maybe my taste buds were on the high from the fresh food but when we got here for dinner I was disappointed.

I had the croquette monsieur, while the really hung over guy next to me had the pino omlette. He enjoyed as much as his stomach could handle. Really friendly staff, and the food was good. Odd decor around you for breakfast, but hey its french, and its vegas, so there's bound to be something not right.","Just had a small early brunch here. Almost deserted for some reason. But the food was very good. Good service too. Decor is traditional, but felt maybe a little out dated.","Small portions for the price. I guess it is ok if you dig the high end dining frech food scene, but it wasn't my thing.","The restaurant seems small compared to others in the hotel, but they packed several large parties into a separate room here for some reason. Loved the dark wood decor, and the food was great, although the value for the price may be a negative factor. My lamb saddle was delicious, and the martinis were excellent. Service was very poor, mainly due to a server that would disappear for long stretches of time , so it took us a while to get our order even started. This was a nice, nice dinner, but I think for the price there are other better options in this hotel, and certainly in Vegas overall.","Really cute French Cafe in the Venetian Hotel. Loved the decor, the cafe bistro tables and chairs. I've had both breakfast and lunch here, both were excellent. Salad Nicoise had some nice pieces of seared tuna, I liked the slice of bagette toast with tapenade and an anchovie fillet. Mussels Mariniere was also very good, lots of garlic!

I felt bad ordering six drinks while she already had other drinks ordered that she didn't make yet with a group of people in line behind me.

Initially, this drink gives a overwhelmingly almond fragrance. I hated it, it was gross. However I spent 5 bucks on this damn drink, so I continued and begrudgingly sucked it up. Weirdly, as I was halfway done, I   stopped noticing the weird almond flavor and started tasting the green tea matcha. I'm confused, and probably will have something traditional at this place next time, if I have to come back.","The drinks here aren't so great, and that would normally make me give fewer stars, but their "" Grand Canyon "" on their Top 10 list is THA ABSOLUTE BOMB!! It's that great it makes up for anything and everything else. Don't bother coming here to drink anything else. The place could be dirty for all I care (it isn't), as long as you have a Grand Canyon you're having 5' s!!!","I'm sitting here, as we speak, digesting my large peach milk tea that had the popping lychee boba in it. Typically I'm waiting for that "" ugh I ate too much "" feeling that I get after boba or real sweet teas...   Doesn't seem to be coming. The milk tea was super light and the peach tasted really good. Lychee added a bit of tartness which is fantastic. Huge menu! Can't wait to come back and try more.","Went here 2 days ago and it was my first visit. I live around the corner and had been skeptic to try a new boba place since I already had my favorite on Dobson. I can say for a first visit this place is AMAZING.

I had gotten the green tea milk tea and was worried about the dairy bc I'm lactose intolerant but the cashier / tea barista assured me that all of the milk teas are dairy free, FANTASTIC.

The staff is always accommodating to new people as well and will go out of their way to make sure that you will get an entree that you will truly enjoy!","The flavors and hospitality were absolutely amazing. The only reason they did not get five stars, was   the temperature of the food.

On the one hand, their meals are cheap and filling, which is great, but the BBQ isn't the best I've had. Mostly, the meat seems a bit dry. If you are in Pittsburgh looking for BBQ, I would recommend you either try a different cuisine or come over to my place!","In line with the other reviews, the owners here are fantastic. The woman behind the counter walked me through their process and got me to sample all the sauces. The second time back she wanted me to try out a new dish they had just put on the menu. I can only speak to their chicken, but it is fantastic. The meat just falls off the bone and the sauces really compliment the dry rub. I tried the extra spicy and the honey mustard--both are great. All in all, this place is a great spot. Friendly staff and great food. I'll be back.","After a ton of hype, I have to say this joint lived up to my expectations. I tried the Brisket and Pulled Pork. The Brisket was moist and broke apart so easily, very succulent. I drenched in their signature tomato based bbq sauce which was my favorite part of the meal. The pulled pork was good as well but the brisket was so much better. I felt the bun on the sandwich could have   been toasted more as it was kind of dry. I will definitely be back to try their ribs, the customer service was excellent.",The brisket was bland and showed no obvious signs of being smoked--this tasteless mess could have passed as a boiled offering. The ribs were the highpoint of the meal and were among the worst I've ever had. Yinz better stay far away.,"Finally got to go to this place. It was fantastic,   the food was better than good and the service was grade A. They asked if we'd been there before,   when we said no, they went to great lengths to make sure we sampled all their sauces and any sides we were interested in. I had the pulled pork and ribs, my wife had the brisket and ribs, both meals were great. The owner came out a few times to check on everyone,   as I said, unmatched service, including the person taking orders. The food earns 4 stars, the service kicks it to 5 stars. From this point in, the will be my go to place for BBQ, no doubt!","Do my eyes deceive me? Is there legit barbecue in Pittsburgh?! Going to Yinzburgh is so much easier than driving down to Georgia when you're craving good bbq. Try the pulled pork, try the ribs, try the bbq burritos! I love gorging on this restaurant's food.

Both had cold bread in fact we got the impression that both sandwiches had been pre made and put in a refrigerator because the insides were also cold. No taste at all in either. For a company that supposedly cooks overnight you would think the turkey ingredients would look like turkey but apparently they shred it into little tiny bits. Will not return","# 1 in Vegas for a reason. Everyone has their favs .... the capistrami, the cheeseteak with mush ... Mine is definitely the Bobby. In case you haven't viewed their menu yet, the bobby is thanksgiving leftovers in a huge sandwich ... yeah, exactly.",Don't bother calling in an order. If they tell you a time it will be off by at least thirty minutes. Terrible service. Great food tho.,"This place is always good, I think the owner actually made my sandwich last time I was there, owner or manager, anyway it was superb! quite flavorful , even the next day it tasted just as good.

The problem though is that this place can be a bit up and down on consistency and you're never going to get anything exactly the same. So some days you may like it and others you may not.","Yummy pho within the North York area! Woohoo. I would say that I enjoy Angus Pho House's broth a lot as it contains lots of onions and scallions. I want to say that this place is quite consistent but unfortunately the last time I went, my friend got a very small portion in terms of meat and noodles, even though we both ordered the same size. Overall, I am quite satisfied with this place. The interior is pretty standard, but you have to go downstairs to get to the washroom. This wouldn't stop me from going here whenever I feel like having pho!","Restaurant has a good grasp of Vietnamese pho soup broth and base, such that the taste is authentic and delicious. Their vermicelli noodles are thicker here than anywhere else I've gone, but was delicious nonetheless. Great service and cheap prices made for a 4 star experience.","It was ok. Not the worst place in the world and not the best. I don't think I would crave the food here or come back anytime soon. My fiancÃ © ordered the curry and rice and one chicken was pink, which he didn't enjoy. I ordered the satay beef soup. Which wasn't too spicy in my opinion. I thought it was good but it wasn't life changing or anything. The only reason we decided to check it out was because they're open late.",Good decent pho in this area. It's about the broth and it's delicious - you can taste the flavours had been boiling for hours. Good sized servings and a nice menu with not much of everything else. Keeping it simple with a classic Hunan chicken to classic house pho. I would say the best in the area.,OK place for a bowl of pho in the Finch area. The lime wedge was fresh and sprouts were crunchy. There is nothing really special or noteworthy about this place. I might try their tom yum or rice dishes next time I'm in the neighbourhood.,"Today was a lazy Sunday for me .. so I decided to order delivery. I've ordered the Thai fried fish cake, I find it lacking in flavour. I was craving for curry fish balls, the curry was not bad but the curry was a bit thick. The fried tofu was very tasty. Just enough flavour and it was crunchy. I really enjoyed this. I've also ordered the Tom yum noodles, it was okay as the soup lacked the spice. I will definitely come back for the tofu and the iced tea!","After reading the reviews I thought I'd give this place a shot, especially cause I was craving soup. The seafood soup is very spicy and delicious. If you order take out / delivery the seafood broth comes in a separate bowl and you can add as much of it to the noodle as you like. The sweet and sour chicken was just alright, nothing special to note. The pad thai has a generous amount of chicken and shrimp and tastes great. I got free coupons for Spring Rolls, and Roti with curry sauce for my next visit.","Since the only other pho restaurant is pho 88 by empress, the food here is decent. However, service is lacking.

I left feeling physically ill. No way would I have ever tried this place if I didn't have a gift card to use. But free wasn't good enough. I should have been paid to eat this garbage. How this restaurant stays in business with all of the far better restaurants nearby is beyond me. , no it's not, stupid people still exist.","I guess it is everything that you would expect from a chain restaurant. Normally, I would give this place 4 stars for the great food, good service, and excellent menu, but it is just so vanilla. There are a million places just like this. To be a little more specific and helpful, the mussels are the best thing on the menu. Save some bread (and room) for this treat. The best entree is the Pollo Rosa Maria. Chicken stuffed with cheese and topped with an excellent gravy mushroom sauce. At the very least, you know you are going to a good restaurant. We are stuffed and you will be too. Best advice, pace yourself but crush the bread.","I had the Pasta Sostanza but instead of Tagliarini I had it with whole wheat spaghetti. I was pleasantly surprised at how DELICIOUS their whole wheat pasta is! I'm so glad I found a spot with a great whole wheat pasta in Charlotte. The rest of the dish was great as well, right down to the artichokes. And if you're in the mood for Sangria - the waitress recommended the Blackberry Sangria and I'm glad she did!",Great food! ( The pork chop was awesome!!! And the Bryan chicken is also really really good! ) we sat at the bar the food came out really quick. Over all I am very happy and will return.,"the only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because the service is very slow. we got in fast for a Saturday lunch but every time we asked our waitress for anything she would come back 15 minutes later? the food is good and comes in large portions but really? 17 dollars for a chicken Parmesan? everything here is expensive. I order the lasagna and was very disappointed, it was COVERED in sauce with barely any cheese or meat. I most likely will not return here. the only thing that was good was dessert, which is wonderful.",Absolutely the worst service I've ever had in any restaurant we were seated at the bar because they had said they had a shortage of wait staff then we were shown to a table we asked twice to have a server visit never saw one as for the manager the manager never appeared so we got up and left,I ordered a seasonal dessert pastry that came in a little cast iron skillet and it was burnt beyond recognition - why was it even served to us. Had hard time getting seated because none of the equipment was working and manager made situation worse by not helping host - it was a mess that left a bad taste along with horrible dessert - will spend money elsewhere.,"Got takeout for lunch. The new online ordering app worked seamlessly. I ordered Chicken Marsala with cavatappi ameritriciana, which was delicious. The lunch portion cost less than dinner, but doesn't include soup or salad. You can add those for $2. The waiter came out as soon as I pulled up. He was very friendly. My food was ready. This was a good experience.

( Avoid their shrimp pasta - watery, Calamari - a bit greasy ) Overall, good experience!","Patio makes it a 4 star. Great patio and view on a summer day with mist and shade on the rooftop. I like their new drink menu but since they changed their food menu, I haven't been a fan. So it's usual if opt out of food and just settle for drinks.",Really liked coming here! It was my first time and the food was amazing! The service was good and the atmosphere was great. It's definitely on the loud side and very casual. I had the chicken poutine and it was to die for.

Come here with friends for drinks for sure.,"Ok - for the food at Jack Astors is good but it is not 4 stars by my rating scale! What gets this location to 4 stars overall is the roof top patio!

We had hot dogs, the cheeseburger, and chicken fingers (for the kids). I personally had El Mexicano and it was super tasty, but $7 for a single hot dog is a little bit ridiculous. The kids didn't like the chicken fingers and the burger was just bad. Customer service was not great either.

Looking forward to trying the dinner menu here.","Great evening (Oct.) under the stars! First of all, it's not a French restaurant, rather the chef is French. They describe themselves as a "" casual American bistro . "" Several of us went and had a great meal! We shared appetizers: crab cakes, calamari, salmon sushi (special that day), and sweet potato fries. They all were great (although the fries could have been crispier for me). We all enjoyed our entrees. I had the risotto with shrimp and asparagus and found it delicious. We shared a couple of decadent desserts (made fresh and change daily). We enjoyed the brownie with apricot pieces and a gelato with chocolate crunchies.",Very disappointed. Staff needs a better education on what they're serving so they can recommend properly. I'm all for healthy but it has to taste good too. Sweet potato fries were very good but served cold. I cannot recommend this as a lunch spot.,"Really good food IF you stay and get past the way they do NOT greet you! It's not France--you need to have good customer service!!! ONLY because my husband is Belgian, we stayed, he's used to bad service. It's NOT clear when you walk in what to do--sit? Menus? Ordering at front and having 3 - 4 empty / half assed stares by too many people is a Mc Donald's concept,   and uncomfortable. Especially the blond running the register. Put her somewhere else, NOT front! Drip coffee overpriced then $ .75 refill? Mon Dieu! Again, very good, get your customer service / set up straightened out. Bonne Chance!!!","Hidden lunch spot. This is the perfect lunch setting including indoor outdoor seating. Customers order at the counter, and items are brought to the table. The food is healthy including vegan and gluten free options, but it actually tastes delicious. The prices are fair and portions generous. We will definitely be back.","THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED.

I never find myself saying "" let's go for dinner, "" but definitely, "" let's meet there. Other restaurants - the Grind is nearby - have menus to brag about. But Kitchen 56 has an open feel, with appreciable curiosities on the walls, and the service has been uniformly engaging.","Kitchen 56 is a great place to stop in during lunch or happy hour. We've had virtually every thing on the menu and the food is always great. They have a fantastic outdoor seating area and will periodically host live music. The restaurant also has a wonderful history. Their downsides are that they redid the menu last year and a lot of our favorites are no longer there, service has been lacking a little lately and they raised their prices (they would've had more stars if it weren't for these things). I guess restaurants think this is something they should automatically do when they are in the Arcadia area.","Food Ok. Subpar service. Found out later that the' waiter' was the General Manager. Waited over half. An hr for the food, and even later for the check. I. hope this guy doesn't try to cook. He would just drop stuff and leave, like a fly landing on the table, then taking off before you could swat it. He never offered us drinks, and WE had to ask for a desert menus. This place got a lot of hype on check please Arizona, which wasn't earned based on our experience.","My bf and I came here one evening to enjoy the Boom56 gathering and I must say, I really really enjoyed this low key gem!!

Disappointed and not planning to return. Wait person was prompt, friendly, and apologetic.",Service was terrible. Was told 20 minutes in reality it was over an hour with no explanation.

I'd go back. Not the beat sushi I've had but not bad.","Very good food, atmosphere and service. I recommend the calamari as an appetizer and the Angry Dragon as a main course. The drinks are good. I had a Long Island ice tea and it was very good. I give this place my highest recommendation. For 3 of us it came to $130. Not bad for what we had.","Fun atmosphere. Huge hibachi area as well as regular dining section as well. I tried both the spicy tuna maki roll and the salmon hibachi dinner. On tuesdays from 5 - 7 pm the maki rolls are half off.

It's not the best hibachi meal I've ever had but it did not disappoint me and its a fun dining experience.

Some of the service isn't the best, but the food at least always comes out good with fresh noodles. It's definitely worth giving them a shot if you want some ramen quick.","Really bad experiences gained today about the horrible services. It was my friend's birthday. The waiter told us there is no table for 8 ppl after we have waited outside for 15 - 20 mins. It's ok if there has no big table for big group, but waiter should tell us in the beginning instead of told us to wait. Wtf??? Really upset, never visit again.","I was there before for they open the store because my greyhound bus arrived early...when they open the door, I immediately ordered the house ramen. To my surprise, it came warm instead of hot, little slices of meat with my noodle soup. And my soup was just too salty so I asked for a cup of tea .. but it was a tea bag tea with charge. I was very disappointed in their service. The waitress was busy talking to the guy cook instead of coming to check on my table. I had to walk to her to remind her that I was ready to pay the bill!!","This used to be the only ramen place on Dundas and now it has been usurped by much better ramen joints. Granted, Kenzo showed up first and has retained it's laid back feel while some of the newer ramen restos are crowded and too cool for school. The noodles at Kenzo are the eggy kind that I dislike. The soup in the tonkotsu ramen is milky like the way it should be. The takoyaki balls are pretty good but they (gasp) have gotten smaller! Sansotei down the street on the opposite side closer to University Ave is far better tasting and better priced. Go there instead ...","Great, authentic ramen and atmosphere. Very flavourful and satisfying. Also excellent donburi. When they opened. Unfortunately, over the past few months it feels as though their success has lead to a drop in quality of the food. In addition to this, one of my favourite comfort foods is no longer on the menu - donburi. Will definitely check in from time to time as even on a bad day they're still one of the better options in the area.","Raman soup base doesn't taste good. It's the soul of the Raman, when it's not good the whole Raman is ruined. Have to come here because the other Raman place down the street has a long lineup.","I work about a block away and I always look forward to trying out new places that are around me, which are numerous. I've tried most of the places on this strip and I think Kenzo really stands out. Excellent soup and great gyoza!! This place makes some amazing Ramen and I love going there for lunch time and time again. I usually get the Netsu - Ramen (Pork & Egg noodle) and I'll say that I probably could eat this dish every day. Great service, and prices , I just wish the place was a little bigger.","Food was so so but service was suck. Only three table was taken, waiters were sitting behind and chatting. I raised and waved my hand several times and nobody notice. Finally the bill came out with 17% gratuity .... They even didn't ask how much tips you like to pay, they just sum up with 17% gratuity.

When we went the server said he needs to make sure if they have met there Groupon quota for the day , when we went it was about 4 pm. Highly unprofessional.

The food was OK, it wasn't so bland that I wouldn't be back but not great enough that I'm making sure we make time to stop in again.","This is a very average sports bar. Strawberry chicken salad was tasty, but chicken was tough and over cooked and mixed greens had way too many browning pieces of lettuce. The candied pecans were delicious, though. Sliders meat to bun ratio wasn't good. Too much bread. Although they grill the buns in butter to try to make up for it. Thumbs up on the potato skins.

They have great friendly service and were very quick getting my food out to me. It was a little costly but that is usually to be expected at sushi places.,I highly recommend the volcano roll or the dragon roll but avoid 1/2 off night unless you want to wait forever and only get the cheap items.,"I love sushi, and maybe I'm a little bit of a snob about it living in California for 11 years. But I just can't get down with this place after trying it a couple times. The sushi is cut very thickly and has a very bland taste. Which I guess is better than a fishy taste, but it's just not good on the palate. Maybe it's the distance the fish has to travel. But I've been to a couple other sushi places in Ohio and they were a lot better. It's probably in part the sushi chef's knife skills. It seems like it's trying hard to be cool. It misses the mark for me.",Love sitting outdoors here in the summer. Good food. A little pricey but it may be worth it. They also make GREAT drinks.,Hard to find free parking in downtown Cleveland but the walk was worth it. Fast friendly service and sushi and rolls were great. Atmosphere was nice too.,"What can I say .... its sushi. They've been around for years. Weds you need a reservation for half priced sushi night. A few of my favorites are the Big Mouth (spicy), Spider (soft shell crab) and Caterpillar. but they are the big rolls. Plus they have my all time favorite dish .... Kani Su (spelling? ) its a bit of crab wrapped in a peeled cucumber and soaking in a light vinegar type. and I think I could eat 5 appetizers of these things.","we stopped in while passing through. good sushi, although the waiter seemed amazed that we'd actually had sushi before! he did walk us through a complicated menu, and we found what we liked just fine. a little pricey but not horridly so.","In town for a business meeting and wanted sushi. A quick walk from the hotel. It was a quite Thursday night so I practically had the place to myself. The choices were plenty and when I asked if they could make a Christmas Tree roll, the chef did not hesitate. It was very good. I enjoyed the Rainbow roll also. The waitress was very helpful in   suggesting some of Sushi Rock's special rolls. Definetly will visit when I am in town again.","The service here was horrible. My work colleague had his food come out literally 20 minutes after everyone else had already finished their meal. To top it off, most of the dishes were mediocre at best, especially the sushi, which had generous portions but was not good enough to justify the price.

The price is way too much for the quality of the food is much to be desired. It is not really authentic like it should be.

He kept telling me how things "" should "" have been done. We both thought it was overpriced, under portioned. We were the only ones in the restaurant   (other than staff ) the night we went, which should have been a warning to us. Everything was meh.

My wife had the goulash and I had the pork with cream mushroom dish. Both were extremely fresh and very good!

It feels like a family owned type of place, where a lot of love and hard work was put into it.

Very good!","New customer lost to greedy owner. First visit today for a quick lunch. Ice tea came, my wife took one sip and said she did not like it and   sent it back and only had water.

Hubby had the German Bockwurst & fries, it was like a giant boiled hot dog, fries OK. I had the Schnitzel Vienna Style , the pork was very dried out, no taste. Now I have eaten quite a few potato pancakes in my day, my mom used to grate them by hand, and fry them in a pan. These were like the took leftover mashed potato formed them into a patty and deep fried them! MUSHY!

I went in and the woman not being so nice said they had no room. Ok, I said I'd try later. I have called this place on numerous occasions to make a reservation, and no one answers.

That said they also have some options for people that like meat as well. The staff can sometimes be a bit slow, but the restaurant does also get very busy so that is understandable. The atmosphere here is also very inviting and nice. The next time you're in the mood for some good food you should give them a shot!","I am a "" vegetarian light "" if you will, and I absolutely adored this menu. The food was delicious, the drinks were divine and the patio was wonderful. The service could have been a little bit better, but not a deal breaker by any means. I would go back in a heartbeat. Definite try if you haven't.","I really want to like this place - wish I could have given it 3 . 5 stars. The staff is great - very professional and friendly. I gave it three stars because there is an over - abundance of lemon on two of the dishes we tried. We ordered the octopus, which was a little tough and tasted like lemon and oregano. Then we got brussels sprouts as a side - also drowning in lemon. It just overpowered both dishes. The lamb burger and eggplant burger we got were both very good. I may give them a try again, but steer clear of the octopus and brussels sprouts!","The smoked trout starter was good but I believe it missed a few toppings that were listed on the menu. The eggplant isn't babaganoush and I'm not sure what it was ... It lacked the smoky flavor I thought it would have like a babaganoush! The octopus (FYI not local! Despite the "" everything local "" them the restaurant goes for) was chewy and didn't have any flavor. It was hard to get through it all (sorry for being harsh! ) The place has a cute feel to it so I'll give it that!","I was hoping for more vegetarian options based on the name. The place smelled great, I just don't have a desire to eat rotisserie anymore, but if you are carnivorous, then this place would be amazing. I ended up having the mac and cheese with shallots and it was quite tasty and filling for only a small price tag of $5. Good location, nice decor and friendly staff.",Sat there for 23 mins and our order hadn't been taken nor the side of lemons bought out that we had requested when we first sat down did notice employees sitting along side of the bar eating everyone was still smiling tho definitely will not return,"Great food, great service, great cocktails, great patio and parking!!!

The staff was helpful in helping me find the exact car for me. I will say that they are a little bit more expensive than other car rental companies I have used however.,"I rent cars for business purposes across many cities and for Vegas, choose Sixt only when I cannot find a luxury vehicle for a reasonable price from hertz, avis or national. The checkin process never takes less than 30 to 40 min. The staff are fine, but the process sucks, if you need to rent and pickup with speed, only go with Sixt if you are not in a rush.","I reserved my rental car through Travelocity and I was thoroughly pleased. I was a little skeptical because the rental with tax was only $194 and some change. The staff are super friendly and the rental place is very bright, a nice orange color. They offer you various drink choices (all non - alcoholic, of course), I will definitely rent from here again.",I had a great rental experience here. I found them through Kayak and then booked a prepaid reservation directly on the Sixt site. The price was right - $49/day for three days' rental of a BMW 328i. There was no upsell hassle for insurance or upgrades and the rental process took less than 5 minutes. The return was also similarly fast and there were no fees or foolishness there either.,"We had never heard of this company. There price for rentals is what brought us to them. I have to say they are fantastic. We arrived in Vegas at 10 : 00pm got to the rental office, which is right across the street from the main rental hub. Our car was ready, they greeted us with a smile and our choice of beverage from their stocked fridge. Very friendly staff. My only complaint would be at turn in time there could have been a couple more clerks working to check the car back in. We will use them again for sure.",Nice friendly people...very accommodating. Even when vehicles were not available they always offered options for different vehicles.,Have to take 2nd shuttle although you can walk a block from the mcCarren rental center. Took over 1 hour to get the car. No upgrades and had to wait for my class of car. They act like they are high tech with QR code but in fact they do everything manually. Their app sucks. Price was decent and cars were nice. But poor customer services means I won't be back.,They are super slow with service. Few people just sitting or standing around doing nothing. One has a trainee badge so at least there is that.,"Was apprehensive after reading reviews, but had an altogether good experience. Rented a car for a ~400 mile roundtrip excursion. Cheapest rates by far. No wait when I picked up my car on a Saturday, car was as promised. Make sure you read what you sign! The contract I was presented when picking up the car had a .50 charge per mile over 100 a day, while the terms I agreed to online said unlimited. I had them cross that off and initial it before I agreed to sign.

This particular Chipotle however, is anything but high quality.  They don't give you enough food to eat.  The food they do give you to eat is stale or old.  Even if its not old food, they way they give it to you is usually very sloppy.  I don't recommend this place at all.","Well I love Chipotle and since I was with my sister after shopping it was the closest location , it was her first time eating here. The food was great but the redhead that works their was rude and impatient to my sister, she's only 12 and it was her first time and she was nt sure what to get so the red head was rolling her eyes and idk If she's gonna work for a fastfood place she needs to learn to be patient. Other than that 4 stars good food that's why! Burrito Bowl my favorite!","Possibly the worst Chipotle I've been to in town. Most of the employees that have served me barely put anything in my bowls. I asked for a little bit more steak, and the lady literally scoops out 1 piece of steak. They sprinkle that on there like it's the last bucket of cheese they have for the next month. And the guacamole? Guac is extra, so I expect at least a proper scoop. She gives me half a scoop. In the end I feel like I'm not eating a steak bowl, but rather a vegetable one.",i like getting the 3 taco combo here. the salsa is so flavorful! i like getting the bowls too. i like everything here! the only downside is you gotta eat really fast or get a separate basket for the tacos cuz they get really soggy at the bottom from the juice from the meat and salsa. they get so soggy the taco comes apart before you bite into it. but if you can get it into your mouth without the insides falling out from the split .. kudos!,"I love Chipotle, but this one gave me FOOD POISONING. Whoever it was I talked to at their corporate wasn't quite helpful, although the manager at this Chipotle was very accommodating when I reported the food poising. They're   nice, but the quality they make when it comes to burrito is not great. It would spill or the burrito wouldn't be wrapped properly. I prefer going to other Chipotles than this one.","As a UNLV student I always find myself at chipotle for lunch in between classes or picking up something to take home after a long day. This particular location is ALWAYS busy, therefore the foods always fresh! Even though all of the employees are fairly young, the service is great. They'll let you sample things you haven't tried, and suggest a new spin to put on your burrito. Love love love. I only doc 1 star because the lines between 12 and 2 (lunchtime) are lonnnnnnnnng. And they will not make quesadilla style burritos during lunch rush (lame).","Below standard, even for Chipotle. Rice was not cooked all the way. Food was lukewarm. Salsas were flavorless (maybe not fresh? ) Pretty disappointing.",I eat here almost everyday for lunch! The wait can be long at certain times but worth the wait- the regular staff is awesome and friendly and they remember my order - I only have issues when they have visitor or new employees but they still get 5 stars because they move the line and are friendly and the food is always fresh and amazing!,"Below average Chipotle. Chips were stale, portions where small, staff was nice though. Ordered a burrito and the girl used a ripped tortilla. When she first saw it she started to get a new one but couldn't pull it out right away so she gave up and used the ripped one. Slightly disappointed.

I definitely recommend for family outings.,"I've been here a few times now, and I love it! Definitely fun for a date or just something to do. My only complaint is that either each obstacle for each hole are longer or create more holes! One round goes by too quickly! Plan on possibly going this Sunday for a double date!","Found this place while on a trip in Phoenix and Scottsdale here on Yelp. Kids loved it. Fun place to beat the heat. Price and value is great, and   location is clean and really fun for kids.","This place is definitely worth the price. They give you a glow in the dark bracelet to start, and you have the chance to win a free round on the last hole. There were a lot of kids there, but as an adult I didn't feel out of place at all. The setup is great inside and I love the little extra touches, like the wheel you spin at one hole that gives you challenges to complete and the ball charging stations. My only complaint is that it got pretty warm in there. Otherwise everything was fine.","We just visited this place over the weekend for the first time.

The exterior of the building is quite nice and this place is pretty big. As soon as you enter the smell of cigarette smoke and the sound of the slot machines hits you .. ting ting ting .. you know you are in Vegas! They are open 24/7 - gambling and food! The crowd here was much older, enjoying drinks, meals and gambling. This wouldn't be my kinda casino to stay it but decent enough.",This is my local go to casino! I bowl here in a league in Friday's.

Given a choice, I'd' donate' my money elsewhere.","We stayed here for one of our weekend getaways and we loved it. We had a room with a view of the golf course, which turned out to be better than expected. We could see a lot of Las Vegas from our room. The bathroom was big and had a huge walk i shower, but no tub. Overall, definitely worth the stay.","Stayed here a few times and will every time in the future! Screw the Strip at $250/per night and extra $25 fridge rental. Here it's all included: vault, fridge in a spacious, quiet room with nice golf course view. There's Starbucks, deli, Fridays, seafood restaurant, bowling, theatre, spa, gym, etc. Best part is it's $60 a night without the strip traffic. I can't justify the higher priced Wynn, Venetian, Bellagio. Rather have that money for dining, shopping, massages and spa treatments. Can't wait for my next trip!","Rooms are huge!

I've had the item at a few places, and my point of reference is Yoshi Burrito, the first place at which I had the dish. That is, for me, a four out of five star place. This is a three, because I think there are a bit fewer options, the burritos are a bit smaller, and overall, the accompanying flavors less compelling than that of Yoshi.

Just enough mayo on the gyro where it complimented the taste rather than took over. This is a small cafe with around 15 tables and you walk in to a aisle leading to the counter to order your food. I liked this place and for $5 how can you beat the price and this is a great alternative for burgers or pizza. Will definitely be back again and try other items from the menu.,"Stopped here yesterday and got take - out. I've eaten at their other location several times and it has seemed like the food has slightly changed over time. Not for the better. I was very disappointed to see a man throw a bag of gray gyro meat chunks on the grill as I walked in. So I guess they don't slice the meat fresh off a spit. My daughter noted that her meat was weird in her gyro - some jagged chunks, large cubes, and thin slices. The taste wasn't up to snuff either--likely from the less than optimal way it was prepared. Their hummus was still good but could use a little more garlic or something. I'll be taking a lengthy break from Pita Cafe.","good,hummus,food -> quality,positive;liked,place,recommendation,positive;little spicy,jalapeno,drink -> quality,positive;nice,pita chips,food -> quality,positive;very delicious,chicken,food -> quality,positive;super clean,location,location,positive;top notch,food,food -> quality,positive;on point,flavors,food -> variety,positive;dog friendly,patio,restaurant -> atmosphere,positive;paper thin,gyro meat,drink -> quality,negative;odd,rice,food -> quality,negative;really cool,owner,staff,positive;really bad,Mediterranean gyro,restaurant -> atmosphere,negative;bad,Lettuce,food -> healthiness,negative;lots of,oil,drink -> quality,negative",good hummus [SEP] liked place [SEP] little spicy jalapeno [SEP] nice pita chips [SEP] very delicious chicken [SEP] super clean location [SEP] top notch food [SEP] on point flavors [SEP] dog friendly patio [SEP] paper thin gyro meat [SEP] odd rice [SEP] really cool owner [SEP] really bad Mediterranean gyro [SEP] bad Lettuce [SEP] lots of oil

Our group shared the appetizer with cheese and cured meats. I ordered ravioli, so delicious!! I couldn't stop talking about it for days. The portions are on the smaller side, compared to other Italian restaurants, yet even still, I was left with a feeling of satisfaction and a desire to order other dishes (appetizer, and dessert). Service was excellent, even during a busy   Friday night. Definitely will come here again and bring my friends to try it!","I always find the food reasonable and the atmosphere, lively. Come by yourself and enjoy your dinner at the bar with a decent selection of by the glass wines. Food is consistently good quality and well priced though not particularly exciting. The dining room size is perfect for keeping the space well occupied, creating enough buzz but not feeling cramped. Staff are usually knowledgeable and well mannered. Avoid sitting near the kitchen as poor ventilation leads to some smokiness in the air. Ok for groups.","Not sure why, but I've always viewed this establishment as the next option if Teroni's was too busy. However, having tried it for the first time last week, Mercatto's is certainly a worthy first option if your looking for casual Italian food.

The house - made chili gives everything the perfect kick and the burn pleasantly creeps up on you. The wontons in red sauce are also spectacular.

Rooms are big and clean. The linens on the bed were great too!! Stayed here while the Ironman competition was in town and it was still nice and quite.

Amanda was the most unpleasant, rude hotel staff person I've ever had the misfortune of meeting. Charged $25 for an early check - in then failed to notify us that our room was ready. Woke up our driver to inform him there's an 8 person limit per hotel room. We have 8 people and 2 hotel rooms. When we informed them of their mistake they kicked us all out and called the police. Apparently the police didn't find Amanda's crack stash in the back office (thank me for the tip later Officers! )",Staff was friendly and my 1 night stay was without a hitch. The room was clean and the pool was relaxing.,Stayed here for one evening. Check in was smooth and easy! Ben was awesome and very welcoming. He shows interest in each customer he is dealing with! First time visiting Arizona and he had good advice on the area. The hotel was pretty clean only problem was the outside light never tired off later in the evening so it felt like we had a night light. Very refreshing pool. Would return again!,Super nice for the price. Have to love getting every penny's worth. Nice lobby and service. Room really plush for $44. HDTV and king size bed. Comfortable and sleek. Great deal. Will recommend for sure.,"Best value for the money in Scottsdale. Recently renovated rooms look more like something out of Vegas for two - thirds the price of nearby competitors. Staff is incredibly accommodating. Stephanie is a closet Victoria's Secret model and a sweetheart. She helped me look through the maid's trash to find a discarded piece of paper (my buddy's fault, not the hotel's). Also, someone may have gotten sick on the sheets and they didn't charge us extra. I'm stopping now.","Find yourself a better spot. No receptacle next to the bed for medical equipment. Toilet must be really old, they're low, like for kids.

I had pistachio eclair and Dark Chocolate Sesame Both eclair and macaron taste very nice - all flavours are so natural and not overly sweet. The pistachio paste inside the eclair is nicely made. The dark chocolate and sesame flavours are well balance that they won't over power each other. The store is very clean and chic; I spent a very nice afternoon there.

Got 6 macarons and 6 eclairs which were packaged in a nice velvet box. They had some cool flavor combos for the macarons but flavor wise, it fell short. The eclairs were okay, didn't have a crisp bite to it. However, they are presented really well. There are better spots on queen west.","Delysees has got to be the best French bakery / patisserie in Toronto I have been here twice - first time for macarons and the second time for croissants. They have decent coffee drinks here but the pastries definitely takes the cake (pardon the pun ) Really great tasting macarons - lots of different flavours and priced reasonably. The fresh croissants are like fluffy heavenly pillows - so buttery, flakey and soft. I would eat these daily if I lived closer.

She suggested a winterberry cocktail which was amazing considering I don't drink cocktails. It was made with Tito's vodka and fresh juice, none of that premade mixer crap. Then had the smoked salmon nigiri which was perfect, then the fire blue special roll and the blazing shrimp. Both were amazing but the blazing shrimp was my favorite, spicy but not kill you spicy.

We leave ourselves in the hands of the chef and he takes such good care of us. I've tried new things - Saba - Uni- and old favorites.

We stopped by after her volleyball game since the yelp reviews were good and we were close by. The rice fell apart under the nigiri pieces. The fish slices were slim and the quality was the same as Teharu (cheap and easy). The spicy tuna roll that came with the combo was bland and smushy. $ later, I'd rather have spent my sushi bucks elsewhere. Plus sides: clean, nice interior, patio. Service was typical.","Disclaimer - we went on a Monday night (birthday dinner), which violates my rules of sushi in Phoenix (don't go on Mondays ) We got a nice assortment of nigiri and maki.

After ten minutes of waiting the drink was finally made and I watched a fellow bartender drink from my drink. He also allowed a customer sitting at the bar to try the drink.

I can't wait to get my next sandwich.,"This place literally has the best chicken sandwich I've ever tasted. The chicken itself is moist, charred, and flavourful, and really stands out as the star of this establishment in my opinion. Their bread is baked fresh and is just awesome. It's sort of a small place so it might get kind of crowded if you're planning on eating there. Take a sandwich (or 2! ) to go - trust me, it's worth it.","Food was good, though I wasn't impressed with the quality of the lamb.

We had a flight (6) plus an extra (they were already sold out of 3 since opening day on tue! ) the three that were memorable to us were Frontside which is their west coast IPA and it was a smooth citrus hop. Midnight run which was not as sweet as your typical coffee stout but still had a hit of chocolate.

It is well located just south of the 1 - 10. The restaurant is clean and the servers were very friendly. I ordered the vegetable and tofu jasmine rice dish. The sauce was very well seasoned and the tofu had great flavor. There were a few too many onions but overall the flavor was great! The shrimp spring rolls are good but the peanut could use some more flavor. The prices are very reasonable. Most dishes are ~$6. 99.

I went with a group of 8 friends here, although my food was average, two of my friends got some type of chicken stir fry dish. The chicken in the dish was spoiled and had a rotting smell! And I know for a fact the smell was not from any sauce or spice, it was just plain spoiled chicken!

I got a coconut black tea with bubbles and was very happy with it.

The bubble tea here is delicious and more customizable than the other bubble tea stores on campus (and cheaper than Chick' N Bubbly), and the store sells cute pastries, including macaroons. Fuku Tea also sells loose, hot teas, which I will definitely be trying in the winter. I'm considering coming here from now on for at least their bubble tea.","Fuku is on my top two best bubble tea places in Pittsburgh! I would say Fuku is great for fruity / tea drinks, whereas at Everyday Noodles I'd prefer to get milk teas there.

They have online quotes, but it can be less or more, so definitely talk to someone real for a realistic quote. Both Bob and Chris are really helpful and seem to really want to help. You can tell they want their customers to keep coming back and build a loyal customer base. When I called Chris on the phone he went above and beyond to help me. Fast service too!","This place rocks! I found a quote to replace my windshield from their website and when I called the manager, Chris, said they would do it for less and have me out the door in less than an hour. I waited less than 20 minutes and my windshield was finished. These guys are awesome! Best deal in town with the best customer service!","Amazing customer service from the Manager, Chris. I got one of my cars tinted about 2 years ago and it's still great to this day (so great that I got my other car tinted as well! ) Good prices and quick turn around    I definitely recommend these guys!","Needing a windshield replacement, I called several different places before coming across Superior. I spoke to Chris who quoted me a price that was nearly half of every other company I called. Needless to say I was hesitant because it sounded too good to be true but I decided to use Superior anyway. Thank goodness I did! Chris was accommodating to my last minute schedule changes, open to any questions and concerns I had, and (most importantly) he stayed true to his price quote and didn't try to get more money out of me. My windshield looks awesome and I am completely satisfied with the quality of work that Chris provided. I will definitely be recommending this place to everyone I know!","I wish I could rate them more than 5 stars. Chris was amazing, from speaking to him on the phone to meeting him in person. He was so enthusiastic and willing to help us out. We're from California and happened to get a chip on the windshield during the drive out to Vegas, but I would drive out here for the great prices and fantastic service. I highly recommend Superior Auto Glass.",Just had my car windows tinted today. Bob was very helpful and my car was done in about an hour...he also gave me a good price. Great job and very efficient. I am recommending Superior to friends and family.,"I moved to Las Vegas 3 years+ ago, and my convertible top was damaged from old age. I asked the guys at Superior for a recommendation on a place to get the top repaired since they are family owned and operated. When I went to their recommended place (West Charelston Auto Upholstery) the Todd Craik at WCAU did the repair free of charge. About 1 month ago I wanted to sell my old 2004 Honda Civic, which had a cracked windshield. I asked Superior for their best cash price ( Green $no credit card) and the finished the installation in 35 minutes with an appointment all for $140! They are competitive and fast!","I got my front windshield replaced after a rock cracked it ... he gave me a great price, and through phone call and in person was excellent customer service!

They have a very large menu to choose from and it includes things like oysters, lobster, crabs, pretty much anything you could want as far as seafood.  They even mix in steak and chicken to some of the meals.  I was very impressed.","We had our wedding reception dinner here. We had a family style prix fixe with an emphasis on seafood. Truly fantastic. Oysters, crab legs, etc. The family style was great, as everyone could try the perfectly cooked steak, scallops, or salmon ( the chicken was fine, but everything else was significantly better). Service was also top notch. There were several people continually helping with each course and making adjustments (wait for the next course, bring the next one faster, etc .). At the end, there was a small mixup with the pricing but that was quickly resolved.","First of all, I am a seafood fan. And both times I went here I was a guest of someone else so I wasn't paying the bill. That being said, the lobster corn dogs are amazing! Also the chilean sea bass. Get the salad that you can customize and you will not be disappointed.","The food and service were very good. As is typical with Vegas, when you get a bottle of wine they are pouring it at the speed of light so your table drinks faster and they ask you if you want another. but actually we'd like to taste it. I had the seabass wrapped in a thin bacon, very good .. The make your own salad with up to ten items was great. Everybody loved the food, the Orin Swift Prisoner by the bottle was fabulous (red blend from Napa), and the service was very good. We closed things out with a tequila shot to get things moving along. Will go back.","First time dining here. Heard much about Michael Mina. Place was pretty empty at 6 pm on a Friday night. Food was a absolute 10, but the wait service was a 2. I must say the buser was fantastic. Our server was too chatty about nothing and was not helpful in making choices. Drinks went dry often this night, we would getr so partched. Fod was fabulous. Appetizer octopus and smelt fries were tasty and inovative. The angry lobster and grilled scallops were perfect. Spicy lobster on a bed of fideo with baby leeks, artichokes and fennel. The scallops were so tender just warmed through.","For an overpriced Vegas restaurant, this one isn't bad. Great seafood platter, good scallops, excellent scalloped potatoes, and they threw in some more potatoes since we ordered so much stuff.","Dinner #2 of last week's vegas trip. I wasn't so hot on the space, as I felt like I could have been eating in a chain restaurant. There was also zero talent in the place. For Vegas, even during a guy - dominated convention, that is simply inexcusable (and don't forget that the AVNers were showing up around then).","Amazing! If you are local and haven't noticed, many properties like MGM have spring / summer tasting menus that are perfect for a nice night out. They range depending on the restaurant of course, but they are amazing deal for a nice 3 - 4 course menu. One of our fav meals so far still, and we've been here 6 years.","My friends and I stayed at MGM last week. After hitting a straight flush in three card poker I thought I'd take the guys out to a solid dinner. For an appetizer we ordered the king crab legs, which were nice and fresh and provided just enough for 3 - 4 of us to sample a couple legs. I ordered the salmon and had it cooked medium. Enjoyable, but nothing spectacular. I believe the others ordered scallops, steak, and pasta. Definitely worth checking out if you win some money at the casino, but otherwise I'd look elsewhere considering the steep price for the good, but not excellent food.","very good,service,staff,positive;family style,prix fixe,recommendation,positive;great,family style,restaurant -> atmosphere,positive;fine,chicken,food -> quality,positive;better,everything,food -> quality,positive;top notch,Service,wait-time,positive;small,mixup,food-quantity,negative;amazing,lobster corn dogs,food -> quality,positive;not be disappointed,salad,food -> quality,neutral;faster,table,restaurant -> comfort,positive;thin bacon,seabass,drink -> quality,positive;great,salad,food -> quality,positive;loved,food,food -> quality,positive;pretty empty,Place,restaurant -> atmosphere,negative;absolute 10,Food,food -> quality,negative",very good service [SEP] family style prix fixe [SEP] great family style [SEP] fine chicken [SEP] better everything [SEP] top notch Service [SEP] small mixup [SEP] amazing lobster corn dogs [SEP] not be disappointed salad [SEP] faster table [SEP] thin bacon seabass [SEP] great salad [SEP] loved food [SEP] pretty empty Place [SEP] absolute 10 Food

The food is authentically Moroccan and they always have great specials that change every day. All of their kabobs feature excellent cuts of meat, fresh vegetables, and are cooked and seasoned to perfection. I also recommend trying their mint tea, it is amazing.","We haven't had good moroccan food in cleveland in quite some time. Place is a small sit down spot right down the block from cedar lee cinema. My wife and sis each had a kabob, one chicken and one beef they were both season well and pretty good, but not the best I ever had. But what I really enjoyed was the couscous which is a north african staple. The restaurant has couscous on fridays and tajines on saturday as specials. I got the lamb couscous (pictured) but beef and vegan couscous were also offered as options. Plus a pot of moroccan mint tea for $5, I will def be coming back to explore more menu options","An authentic Moroccan experience! Start with the mint tea and order the special of the day. If it is beef tajine (like today's lunch), then you're in for a real treat! The owner, Mo will start you off with a crisp salad and warm bread.

The owner is very personable, friendly, and attentive. Make sure you tell them if you want the tea or not because it will be added to your bill. We never asked for it but it was presented so we thought it was included.","Absolutely recommend this one and only Moroccan restaurant in Cleveland! Three of us shared tabouli, beef kabob, chicken kabob, Harira soup, French cookies and hot sweet mint tea. They cook with a wood fired oven that brings a delicious smokey flavor to the food. Even the veggies were cooked in the oven. The bread was divine! The decor was of course very Moroccan with fluffy sofas and several colorful poufs to sit on. Muhammed is a very friendly host. Definitely check this place out!","Exceptional. Well priced, phenomenal service, fresh and high quality ingredients, and delicious food. I had beef kabob, rice, and vegetables, accompanied with the fresh, made daily in house bread. The meal was served with a great salad, which may be the nicest house salad I've ever seen. I found myself returning the next day and tried the chicken kabob, which was again perfectly cooked and seasoned. For the price you get a very good amount of food. They don't over do it at all, you will feel satisfied after your mean but not overly stuffed. I have no hesitation returning to this restaurant and recommending it to others.","MoMo's is an absolute gem of a restaurant! The food is incredibly tasty--perfectly spiced and cooked. All ingredients are fresh and high - quality. If you are looking for truly outstanding, authentic, healthy food--this is your place. Our server was incredibly attentive and welcoming.

Some of the smoothies are made with powdered flavorings if you dislike that kind of thing but they are great. They seem to have off days every once and awhile because the last time I was there the doughnuts tasted pretty bad but that was just one visit and everyone gets a second chance.","This place is pretty small, but they have a lot of donut choices.

Good customer service.","Don't be fooled by the name, it is possible to eat healthy foods at this establishment.

Every time I have gone, the owner always gives me a couple of donut holes, free of charge. I don't eat donuts often, but when I'm in the mood for one I'm fortunate enough to live just down the street from this place. Everyone in the Mesa area should come here at least once. Their coconut cream filled donuts are to die for. Their smoothies are amazing too. If I could write a million 5-star reviews for them, I absolutely would.","Would give this place more stars, but I haven't tried my raspberry fritter yet. This review is for their drinks. Unfortunately, they use powdered flavoring a for their drinks. I was excited when she had said that they use "" real fruit "" in their fruit yogurt drinks. To my disappointment, even asking if she could add some extra blueberries, she poured in about 5 - 6 blueberries over about 2 ounces of a liquefied yogurt, added powdered flavoring a and ice and water, and there appeared my wonderful blueberry yogurt shake. No thanks .... Maybe I would come again for donuts.","Best donuts I have found in Mesa or AZ in the 28 years I've lived here!

We ordered a berry smoothie, French Vanilla Iced Coffee and two old fashioned donuts.

I don't necessarily have a problem with this but if that s the case at least make sure that the beer is cold.

Blossom has stood out, they do their own mix on traditional dishes. I recommend the Beef Chow Fun, Walnut Prawns, & the Fried Flounder. The walnut prawns are by far the best I've ever had, they are not completely soaked in the mayonnaise. There is enough drizzle to where you can still taste the shrimp. And placed underneath is a mound of cantaloupe and honeydew, I have never tasted a more perfect combination. The flounder is fried to a crisp and juicy.

I went to this place maybe five times and my last visit the portions were way smaller. The food here is good but apparently they cut their portions.

There selection rotates often but you can always find something good. The added music just sets this place that much closer to perfection.,"Who would have thought that December would be a good time to have lunch on the patio at Dean and DeLuca? That is what I did today and it was divine. I love coming here to build my own salad. I had the pear vinaigrette dressing and I could have sucked that up through a straw. Even though it is a little pricey, the options for the salad bar and sandwich bar and sides are the best. It's also a fabulous place to pick up a bottle of wine or some spices or other kitchen items. The atmosphere here is trendy and there is usually a good number of patrons dining and shopping. Definitely a winner in Charlotte.",What a nice place. wish there was a bit of better explanation of what to do but it tasted wonderful. A bit pricey but I could tell that when I walked in.

It's the simple things in life .... I heart you D&D wine room .... thank you for a great Thursday night!","The wine bar has a nice selection of wines, albeit a little on the expensive side. The service was decent although flagging down someone for another glass at times can be a bother. This seemed to be an issue for tables that were further from the bar.

I would know if my card was given back to me especially if it was on top of the receipt. I was made to feel really uncomfortable because I was told that I had misplaced my own card.

Some of the food chews weird and is a bit pricey for what you get",Nothing all that spectacular in my opinion. Marinated beef was chewy and I ended up picking out most of it. Sauces tasted a little bland after cooking. Dinner bowl is $9 . 99 which is a little pricey considering the choices and portions. I'd rather pay a little more and go to Kabuto Japanese Steak house where the food is cooked in front of you with some added entertainment provided by the cook. Good thing I had a coupon so I was able to shave a little off the total. I think one visit is good enough for me.,This place should be great. It is a chain and I've eaten at other ones - but this place is just to busy and poorly run. The service is sporadic and the erratic. The proteins in the food bar were frozen. The kitchen keeps the restaurant open and maybe on slow nights this place is still a go to for midweek ethnic food - but on weekends stay away. We got our appetizer after our entree.,"We were looking for something different and I've driven by a bunch of times.

On to the grill and a few minutes later we were chowing!","Giving a 2nd update, and I have to downgrade again. And I would tell you not to even give this place a chance. Went here for a birthday; not by choice. Prices are rising for the bowls. Even with a water, you can't get a normal sized bowl and walk out for less than $15 (when adding in tip). At that price, you shouldn't be serving up frozen meat. Genghis Grill has slowly lost customers at this location and the lower food quality is why. I used to be a loyal patron 4 years ago but they cut corners on the food. Do not waste your time here unless you want to pay $15 for frozen chicken.","Great selection of fresh meats and vegi's - sauces are to die for; reasonably priced and kids love it. Watch out for coupons, they have them often.","This was a fun place to eat,   you can build your own bowl (like a typical mongolian restaurant) and they have an unlimited option for $4 more which is great for trying different creations. One thing i really liked was the "" starch ""   options. They offer noodles and rice,   but also offer things like tortillas which adds a whole new element. Very reasonably priced.","This is some of the most interesting and delicious food I've had in a LONG time. You get seated, then go up and load up your bowl.

It is open 7 days a week, for lunch and dinner, but the above mentioned times are when I usually come to eat.

One of the most delectable items on the menu is the Harvest Salad.  It has blue cheese, lots of greens, pecans, and other stuff to give it that great flavor.  They also serve burgers and seafood.  If you're hear to get a drink or too, the bartenders are friendly and talented.","It kills me that this place is closing! That location is cursed! Thank you to the owners and staff for the delicious meals I've eaten and tasty drinks I've drank, I will miss Barrelhouse greatly!!","I'm so happy to have tried Barrelhouse! Stopped there for lunch today and had the Harvest Salad (beets, blue cheese, candied pecans, jicama, and field greens) and split the chocolate pot de creme with a friend. Heaven!! The restaurant is beautifully decorated inside and it was easy to forget we were in a strip mall in Chandler. This is my new favorite place.","I am smitten with the Barrelhouse. Justin, Eric, and Sandy made my experience wonderful. They had a flirty menu of cocktails that played sultry, sensory   games in my mouth .... providing me with a balance of flavors and the tastes of true mixology. I was impressed with the staffs knowledge and passion for all things mixable and drinkable. I recommended these guys for their unforgettable spirits,   fine conversations, and an immeasurable   quality of service. Simply sweet.","Superb dining experience. From the thick cut potato chip snack, the warm cheddar bisquits through the salad of field greens with candied pecans and blue cheese, to the duck confit and lobster baked chili rellenos, everything was a feast for the tastebuds. We hardly had room for the white chocolate and raspberry bread pudding but couldn't   leave without trying it- we were not disappointed. Barrelhouse ranks among the top restaurants in greater Phoenix.","We had several craft brews and the waitress had a ton of knowledge. Great draft beer selection. Ordered the burger ....... amazing. It came with the garlic fries. Location is terrible, never would have found this place without yelp. Thank you yelp, we will be back!!!","I tried this place for   the first time last Tuesday night with my girlfriend. One of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Justin the bartender made us the most incredible drinks, .. he is a master at his craft. The food we had was absolutely amazing!! I will be back.","You guys are crazy. Maybe your regulars and just love it. Good for you. We are regulars in Gilbert at a number of places and I have been to just about every worthwhile wine bar, tapas place, or cocktail lounge in AZ and a lot of the west coast and this place doesn't compare. The decor is a yawn and the vibe is like being in an elevator with that horrible music. The cocktails were fine and ordered some small stuff. I ordered a burger with no cheese and of course it has cheese. No dairy, a simple request. Made another and it was practically raw. I should give it 1 star but whatever.

They must stop making fresh donuts early in the day and just sell what is left over. The donuts are heavier and denser that K Creme with less flavor.","Customer service is always more important than the food quality, that's why I give it 1 star. I was in the drive thru, had asked the worker to take ice out of my coffee ( there was more ice than coffee) and she walked back and came back with the same amount of ice. I guess she thought I was stupid and that I wouldn't notice. So I sent her back to take out more. Do the job right the first time and you won't have to do it twice.

The atmosphere here is mostly college students and the bar itself isn't the cleanest. Yes you can hear country music in the background, but it just feels like you're walking into an everyday bar once you look at the staff and patrons. Can be pretty bad on service too. Not recommended. Drinks are ok though, but nothing amazing.",Wasn't impressed. Walked in on a Sunday around 5. There were 4 people in the bar. Bar was dirty. Was going to order food but decided against it due to the mess. Had the apple pie moonshine. Flavor was good. Served in a shot glass. I understand it's a college bar but my friends and I wanted to have a drink not act like retarded frat boys. Maybe serve drinks in jars? This place is probably okay if you're looking to get drunk on a weekend. Not a place to go if you want to sit and catch up with some friends and do a little Sunday funday social drinking,Do they play country music most of the time? Do they have a mechanical bull? Do they have two - step dancing? But are they a country bar? Not exactly ... Moonshine is definitely a country bar with a college town twist. They have a great dance floor and most people are doing the two - step and doing it well. Makes me wish I learned more as a kid. The bar also has plenty of bar staff to help you get a drink in a timely manner. This is the best place to go just off Mill to have a good time. They are also open on the weekend till 3 am. Check it out!,"In my option, this is a very good spot for country music. One thing i notice about the bar staff the prices are different ever time. I would clean that up because Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row will take them out of business. The mechanical bull is fun way to bring in business","I wish I could give no stars! I don't ever write reviews but I went there this past weekend and first of all they ran out of bud light, no big deal but the whiskey lemonade was terrible and customer service was even worse. The manager Ryan was not nice at all. He completely ignored my friends and I when we were just trying to get a better tasting whiskey lemonade. When I asked who the manager was he slapped my hand and told me he was and too back off. Then proceeded to ask the guys behind us in line what they wanted. I immediately left, night ruined.","I have given this place a try on more than one occasion. I have tried day drinking there and going at night on the weekend. This place is the quintessential fake country bar. I guess you ca nt expect anything different from a mill ave / college town bar. The drinks are over priced and the music is terrible. The only saving grace to this place is the day time bar staff are really hospitable. The night time staff however, not so much but that is to be expected of a high volume bar.

Good chicken, vegetable and rice dishes!","Called and asked where I could find a menu online to place a take out order. Was told UrbanSpoon and facebook. Only urbanspoon had a menu and I asked saying it was from 2011 and was told that was right. When I later called to place the order, the price was $14 more than what the menu on urbanspoon had. I hung up and redid the math and called again. I was told if I was unhappy with their prices I could go elsewhere, no apology for an employee telling me to find an inaccurate menu online. I was pretty surprised by the rude customer service.","Situated at the very end of the sprawling Settlers Ridge shopping / dining complex, this is a decent option for Thai fare. The service is always fast and friendly even during the lunch rush. No bar but they are BYOB friendly. I'm a curry guy and usually get the Massaman with extra veggies and coconut rice. I like it a lot. GrapeWife has tried several dishes and liked them all. The high ceiling in the dining room creates a spacious yet comfortable atmosphere. The round enclosed booth offers some privacy I you're into that. Give them a try. I think you'll be pleased.","Why is it so hard to find good Thai food! First timer and new to area. Had the tom yum soup which was just ok. Would not order again. For the meal, ordered the drunken noodle. The noodles where not the good fat noodles...but the thin ones. That stinks. Very mild flavor and spice. Try a different dish. I'm not sure if this restaurant just caters to the American palate but they need more flavor.","I wasn't a big fan of this place for a few years. The food is really good now. This is my 2nd time here, I just had it last weekend. I got jap chap with chicken and green curry with chicken and coconut rice, I couldn't decide which one I wanted. It didn't disappoint. Today I got the sautÃ © ed mango with shrimp and extra coconut rice. I am so glad this place turn itself around. I'll keep coming back as long as they keep it up.","It is a nice place, service was great but...we came there to eat pho and it was horrible. Beside that we ordered summer rolls which were pretty good.","I like this place for their Aram Tofu Mushroom Soup - but even this time it was way too salty. The Tofu Pad Se Ew tasted like bad chinese hor fun take - out and was extremely salty and spicy (even though I ordered a spicy level of 2 of 5). The Tofu Pad Se Ew also had a random piece of chicken in it, which was very weird. Had I been a vegetarian I would have been very upset. Every other Thai place I'd been too has waaaaay better Pad Se Ew. Stick to this place if you want salty basic / meh chinese type food.",My mom and I ordered 3 dishes to share and everything we got was delicious. We ordered the pad this with chicken and tofu the curly fries rice with chicken and shrimp and the honey walnut with chicken. My daughter got the lo mein with chicken and enjoyed it.

The birthday parties run very smoothly and the pizza is from Seattle Dan's. I was disappointed in the pizza which appeared to have been reheated or kept in a warmer too long. The only other food they have is wierd looking sliders and frozen fried foods. However the cake was very good. They have plenty of discounted days and pay one price nights. Overall a great place for the kids.","Quite easily the best Laser Tag place in the valley. And by far the coolest arena. People who work there are totally awesome.

Clearly he got the job because he knows someone.,"Huge,portions-,food-quantity,positive;good-,drinks,drink -> quality,positive;very creative,selection-,food -> variety,positive;good,everything,food -> quality,positive;good,desserts,food -> quality,positive;okay,food,food -> quality,neutral;absurd,bill,value-for-money,negative;nothing,Food,food -> quality,negative;fine,Service,staff,positive;aiiiight,beers on tap,drink -> alcohol,neutral;above average for,pub food,food -> quality,positive;little salty,staff,food -> healthiness,negative;favorite,quesadilla,drink -> quality,positive;eclectic,beers,drink -> alcohol,positive;very cool,option,food -> variety,positive",Huge portions- [SEP] good- drinks [SEP] very creative selection- [SEP] good everything [SEP] good desserts [SEP] okay food [SEP] absurd bill [SEP] nothing Food [SEP] fine Service [SEP] aiiiight beers on tap [SEP] above average for pub food [SEP] little salty staff [SEP] favorite quesadilla [SEP] eclectic beers [SEP] very cool option

The staff is very friendly and helpful but rush around a bit . The owner is also friendly. The place itself is average to below average.,"The sushis were nice. I especially liked the Dragon Roll from the 8 sushis we tried here. We tried the Dean's, Dragon, Veggie, Rock and Roll, twister, American Dream and two others. I could say the dragon and rock and roll were among my most favorite ones but the veggies was probably the least favorite.",Great sushi and very friendly staff (even the sushi chef and owner asked how my meal was) but the SiriusXM Love station was brutal to listen to.,"Sushi with great mouthfeel, well - executed rice, but not a ton of flavor. I ordered the Sushi deluxe meal, which comes with 10 pieces of nigiri (fish on top of rice, which is the only sushi in Japan . ) This comes with miso soup and the common sesame ginger salad. The miso soup was flat in flavor and the salad was OK. A bit too much sweetness / acidity from the dressing. The sushi selection was predictable. Tuna, salmon, snapper, and bbq eel. The fish was very creamy in mouthfeel (excellent) but none of them impressed me in flavor except the bbq eel, which was smoky and sweet. Rice was of good execution.","We went on a surprise date to a new place. They were totally packed and had 2 servers on. Maybe a call off and that happens. But our server could barely get to us and just dropped food and ran. If she really looked, she would have seen we didn't eat one sushi roll. The Dean. Pureed and super fishy. The Udon Noodles seemed Way over cooked. Wine list was crap, but I wasn't expecting anything great. We left hungry and will not return because of the food. I can forgive some slow service.",Wonderful sushi ver much more on the traditional side. Worth checking out if you're in Pittsburgh.,We really like this place--super friendly owner and have never a wait for a table. Reasonably priced generous sushi boats that are excellent. I despise mayo and this is the one sushi restaurant where I don't have to worry. The house salad dressing is very good and the udon soup bowls are a perfect warmup in winter. The green tea is made with leaves and not tea bags which is a nice change of pace.,"I heard great things about this place, which is why I was really looking forward to it. Not sure if I hit them on an off night, but the sushi was not good. I sure hope this isn't the best sushi in Pittsburgh. Didn't care for the atmoshphere ... kind of dingy.",Stunningly bad ...
